TL; DR: take care of your body

No matter what elements of my setup is shared with yours, now or never, our bodies are mostly the same.  So this stuff matters to everyone.

Chances are that if you're reading this, you've already spent years (decades?) hunched over a keyboard, eyes bolted into a progressively more rectangular lightbox.  This repetitive abuse will leave its marks, and you should attend to them whether or not standing a bit more becomes part of your regimen.

For example, my optometrist has recommended a simple 20-20-20 rule.  Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.  This eliminates (or at least significantly reduces) the eye strain borne of constantly focusing on something about as far as your navel.

But your muscles (and other soft tissues) probably bear the brunt of your self-abuse.  Butt-surfing leaves your hip flexors short.  Keyboard-hunching does the same for your upper chest.  Standing will not solve this.

I repeat, standing will not magic away tends of thousands of hours of terrible posture.  You're going to have to stretch and exercise your way out of it.  On the upside, the body is a pretty fascinating system so if you approach things as a hacking project to fix your infrastructure it's not so bad, really, except for all the pain.  So much pain.

HOWEVER, a full physical care regimen is well beyond even this budding novel of ergonomic pedantry, plus you can really hurt yourself so pay attention to more qualified people.  This is your warning that standing-desk-jockey-ing can help some things as well as bring existing problems into sharp relief.

Take the changeover as a motivation to solve it rather than wallow in your brokenness, eh?  You may need to put in some work getting your business in line.  Oh, and, if you can't observe the improvement, the thing you're doing is not working.  Science, bitches.

BODIES ARE FASCINATING and you have one take care of it.  Until then, sit on your butt and take in some videos!
